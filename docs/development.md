# Development

## Development environment

```sh
git clone https://github.com/farbzen/narf.git
cd narf
devenv shell              # or: direnv allow
```

[devenv](https://devenv.sh) provides the Nix and Rust tooling; the `.envrc`
loads it automatically with [direnv](https://direnv.net).

## Static analysis and tests

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

The unit tests live in a `tests` module at the end of the source file they
cover and test pure logic only: argument parsing, tilde expansion, the commit
message, the TUI's command line, hints, host picker and input selection, and
reading the flake inputs from the lock file. Calls to git, nh and nix as well
as rendering are not covered. `nix build` runs the tests as well.

The workflow [`.github/workflows/rust.yml`](https://github.com/farbzen/narf/blob/main/.github/workflows/rust.yml)
runs the same commands in the devenv shell on pushes to `main` and on pull
requests that touch the Cargo workspace, the devenv files or the workflow.
When a GitHub release is published, the workflow runs as well; after lint and
tests have passed, a build job runs `cargo build --workspace --release
--locked` on `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux` and attaches `narf` and
`narf-tui` to the run as the artifacts `narf-x86_64-linux` and
`narf-aarch64-linux`. It also uploads them to the release as
`narf-<system>` and `narf-tui-<system>`.

> [!NOTE]
> The ELF interpreter of the binaries points to the glibc in the Nix store of
> the devenv shell, so they only run where that store path exists, such as
> NixOS with the nixpkgs revision of `devenv.lock`.

## Build and check

```sh
nix build .#narf          # build the workspace
nix flake check           # evaluate all outputs
nix run nixpkgs#alejandra -- flake.nix
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Flakes only see files tracked by git. Run `git add` on new files before
> `nix build` or `nix flake check`.

## Layout

| Path          | Content                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Cargo.toml`  | Cargo workspace with the shared version, edition and license |
| `narf/`       | `narf` crate: library and command-line tool                  |
| `narf-tui/`   | `narf-tui` crate: terminal frontend                          |
| `flake.nix`   | flake outputs; builds the workspace from the local checkout  |
| `docs/`       | documentation, also the source of the documentation site     |
| `book.toml`   | [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) configuration  |

## Documentation site

The documentation at <https://narf.farbzen.de/> is built with
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) from the Markdown files in
`docs/`; `book.toml` configures the book, `docs/SUMMARY.md` the chapters in
the sidebar and `docs/README.md` the start page.

```sh
mdbook serve              # preview on http://localhost:3000
mdbook build              # build into book/
```

New files in `docs/` need an entry in `docs/SUMMARY.md` to become a chapter.
Links to files outside `docs/` point to GitHub, since the book contains only
`docs/`. The workflow
[`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](https://github.com/farbzen/narf/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)
builds the book in the devenv shell and deploys it to GitHub Pages on pushes
to `main` that touch `docs/`, `book.toml`, the devenv files or the workflow.
The custom domain `narf.farbzen.de` is set in the repository's Pages settings;
`book.toml` also writes it as `CNAME` into the book.

## Release

1. Set the new version in `Cargo.toml` and the version badge of
   `README.md`, run `cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock`, and move the
   `Unreleased` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` to a new `[<version>] - <date>`
   section with its link at the end of the file.
2. Commit as `chore(release): <version>`, tag the commit as `v<version>` and
   push `main` and the tag.
3. Publish the GitHub release with the changelog section as notes, which
   starts the build job that attaches the binaries:

   ```sh
   gh release create v<version> --verify-tag --title v<version> --notes-file <notes.md>
   ```
